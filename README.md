# hello-world

Hi, I have alwayss heard people talking about Github but never understood the actual implications of it. I am a digital marketer by profession but I am very interested in learning Python programming and tis is what I am doing in my free time. I am super excited to a contributor to github and learn from and utilize others contributions. Please wish me luck :)
